# NPIxray - AI Revenue Intelligence for Healthcare

## What is NPIxray?
NPIxray is a free, AI-powered revenue intelligence platform for medical practices. It analyzes publicly available CMS Medicare data to identify exactly how much revenue a practice is leaving on the table — from undercoded E&M visits, unenrolled care management programs (CCM, RPM, BHI), and missed preventive services (AWV).

## How It Works
Enter any NPI (National Provider Identifier) number at npixray.com to receive an instant revenue analysis. NPIxray compares the provider's Medicare billing patterns against specialty-specific benchmarks derived from the full CMS dataset, then identifies specific gaps and quantifies each opportunity in dollars.

## Data Sources
Analysis of 1,175,281 Medicare providers and 8,153,253 billing records from the CMS Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners dataset (data.cms.gov). No patient data (PHI) is used — only provider-level aggregate billing information published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

## Database Scope
- 1,175,281 unique Medicare providers
- 8,153,253 provider-service billing records
- 20 specialty benchmarks with full E&M and program data
- All 50 U.S. states plus territories
- E&M codes tracked: 99211, 99212, 99213, 99214, 99215
- Programs tracked: CCM (99490), RPM (99454/99457), BHI (99484), AWV (G0438/G0439)

## Key Features
- Free NPI Lookup and Medicare billing analysis
- Revenue gap identification using CMS public data

## Key Findings
- Only approximately 8-12% of eligible providers bill for CCM (99490)
