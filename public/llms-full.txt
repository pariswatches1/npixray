# NPIxray — AI Revenue Intelligence for Healthcare

> NPIxray is a free AI-powered revenue intelligence platform that X-rays medical practices using publicly available CMS Medicare data. It analyzes 1,175,281 providers and 8,153,253 billing records to identify exactly how much revenue a practice is leaving on the table from undercoded E&M visits, unenrolled care management programs (CCM, RPM, BHI), and missed preventive services (AWV).

## About NPIxray

NPIxray was built to solve a critical problem in healthcare: most medical practices don't know how much revenue they're missing. Traditional billing analytics tools cost $500-2,000/month and require months of integration. NPIxray delivers instant, free revenue analysis using publicly available government data.

The platform serves solo practitioners, group practices, FQHCs, rural providers, hospital outpatient departments, medical billing companies, and practice managers. No login, credit card, or integration is required.

## How It Works

1. A user enters any NPI (National Provider Identifier) number at npixray.com
2. NPIxray retrieves that provider's Medicare billing data from its database of 8.15M+ records
3. The system compares the provider's billing patterns against specialty-specific benchmarks
4. It identifies specific revenue gaps: undercoded E&M visits, missing care management programs, low AWV completion
5. Each opportunity is quantified in dollars with actionable recommendations
6. A Revenue Score (0-100) summarizes overall optimization level

## Data Sources and Methodology

Primary data source: CMS Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners dataset from data.cms.gov
- File: "Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners — by Provider and Service"
- URL: https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-physician-other-practitioners
- Coverage: Calendar year 2022-2023
- Format: Provider-level aggregate billing data (no patient PHI)

Database scope:
- 1,175,281 unique Medicare providers
- 8,153,253 provider-service billing records
- 20 specialty-level benchmarks with full E&M and program data
- All 50 U.S. states plus territories
- E&M codes tracked: 99211, 99212, 99213, 99214, 99215
- Care management codes: CCM (99490, 99439), RPM (99454, 99457, 99458), BHI (99484), AWV (G0438, G0439)

Methodology:
- Specialty benchmarks are calculated from the full CMS dataset, not samples
- Revenue gap = (benchmark rate - provider rate) x provider patient volume x code payment rate
- E&M distribution analysis compares 99213/99214/99215 ratios against specialty peers
- Program adoption rates calculated as percentage of providers billing each code within a specialty

## Key National Findings

- Only approximately 8-12% of eligible providers bill for CCM (CPT 99490)
- The average family medicine practice underutilizes 99215 by an estimated 15-25%
- RPM adoption rates vary by state from approximately 2% to 18%
- AWV completion is highest in Family Medicine at approximately 54%
- The average practice leaves an estimated $50,000-$200,000 per year in uncaptured Medicare revenue
- Internal Medicine has the highest CCM opportunity due to chronic condition prevalence
- Cardiology shows the widest E&M coding variation, suggesting significant upcoding opportunity
- Rural practices tend to have lower program adoption rates but higher per-patient revenue potential
